## 📊 Current System Capabilities

### What Works Now ✅
1. **Basic Sync** - Files sync between peers automatically
2. **Delta Transfer** - Only changes are transmitted (bandwidth efficient)
3. **Peer Discovery** - Devices find each other on same network
4. **Security Alerts** - Ransomware-like activity is detected
5. **CLI Control** - Monitor and control via command line
6. **Latency-Based Routing** - Chooses fastest peers

### What's Missing ❌
1. **Security** - No session codes, encryption in transit
2. **Conflicts** - Can't handle simultaneous edits properly
3. **Logging** - Minimal logging, hard to debug
4. **Bandwidth** - No throttling or progress tracking
5. **Resilience** - Doesn't handle offline/reconnect well
6. **Ignore Files** - Syncs everything (including .git, node_modules)
7. **Recovery** - No backup/restore mechanism
8. **Performance** - Not optimized for large scale

## 🎯 Recommended Development Order

### Phase 4A: Critical Features First (6 weeks)
**Sprints 11, 12, 14** - These must be done before production deployment
1. Session Code Security (2 weeks)
2. Conflict Resolution (2 weeks)  
3. Logging & Monitoring (2 weeks)

### Phase 4B: Important Features (6 weeks)
**Sprints 13, 16, 17** - Needed for real-world usage
4. Bandwidth Management (2 weeks)
5. Backup & Recovery (2 weeks)
6. Network Resilience (2 weeks)

### Phase 4C: Polish & Release (8 weeks)
**Sprints 15, 18, 19, 20** - Final improvements
7. File Ignore System (2 weeks)
8. Performance Optimization (2 weeks)
9. Testing & Documentation (2 weeks)
10. Release Preparation (2 weeks)

**Total Time to v1.0:** 20 additional weeks (~5 months from now)

## 🚀 Quick Wins (Can be done now)

These are small improvements that would have immediate impact:

1. **Add `--version` flag** to daemon and CLI
2. **Improve error messages** - More helpful, actionable messages
3. **Add systemd service file** - Easy daemon management
4. **Basic config file** - JSON/YAML instead of command-line args
5. **Graceful shutdown** - Wait for transfers to complete
6. **File sync statistics** - Count files synced in CLI status
7. **Better console output** - Colors, formatting, less verbose
8. **Signal handling** - SIGHUP to reload config
9. **PID file** - Prevent multiple daemon instances
10. **Daemonize option** - Run as background service

## 💡 Architecture Improvements Needed

### Current Issues
1. **No proper error handling** - Many errors silently ignored
2. **No transaction support** - Database can get inconsistent
3. **Memory leaks possible** - Some shared_ptr cycles
4. **Thread safety** - Some shared state not protected
5. **No connection pooling** - Opens too many sockets
6. **No message queuing** - Can lose events under load
7. **Hardcoded paths** - /tmp socket, plugin paths
8. **No configuration validation** - Bad config causes crashes

### Recommended Refactoring
1. Add proper Result<T, Error> type for error handling
2. Implement ACID transactions for database operations
3. Review all shared_ptr usage for cycles
4. Add mutex/lock guards to all shared state
5. Implement connection pool for peer connections
6. Add event queue with backpressure
7. Make all paths configurable
8. Add config schema validation
