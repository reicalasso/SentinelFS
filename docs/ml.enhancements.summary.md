## âœ… Completed Enhancements

### 1. Advanced Anomaly Detection
**Purpose**: Detect unusual file access patterns that may indicate security threats or system issues.

**Implementation**:
- Enhanced `MLAnalyzer` with multi-dimensional anomaly detection
- Classification of anomalies into specific types:
  - `UNUSUAL_ACCESS_TIME`: Access during off-hours
  - `LARGE_FILE_TRANSFER`: Unusually large file operations
  - `FREQUENT_ACCESS_PATTERN`: Abnormally frequent access
  - `UNKNOWN_ACCESS_PATTERN`: Unusual access patterns
  - `ACCESS_DURING_SUSPICIOUS_ACTIVITY`: Access during suspicious activities
- Confidence scoring for anomaly severity
- Feature extraction combining:
  - Temporal patterns (hour, day, week patterns)
  - File characteristics (size, type, importance)
